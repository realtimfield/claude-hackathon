# Jigsaw Piece Transformation Plan

## Executive Summary

This plan outlines the comprehensive transformation of the current rectangular puzzle pieces into realistic jigsaw puzzle pieces with interlocking tabs and cutouts. The implementation requires significant architectural changes across the entire stack, from piece generation algorithms to rendering systems.

## Current State Analysis

### Existing Implementation
- **Piece Shape**: Perfect rectangular grid-based pieces
- **Image Processing**: Simple `getSubimage()` cuts from original image
- **Rendering**: CSS background-image on DOM `<div>` elements
- **Snapping**: Grid-position based with 80px threshold
- **Storage**: Individual piece images as JPEG bytes in Redis

### Key Constraints
- No edge type definitions (tabs/cutouts)
- No shape-aware collision detection
- No piece-to-piece connection logic
- Rectangular assumptions throughout codebase

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Data Model Enhancement

#### 1.1 Piece Edge System
**New Classes:**
- `PuzzleEdge`: Define edge types (FLAT, TAB, CUTOUT)
- `EdgeCurve`: Bezier curve definition for tab/cutout shapes
- `PieceShape`: Complete piece outline with 4 edges

**Edge Generation Rules:**
- Border pieces: Always FLAT edges on puzzle boundary
- Interior pieces: Randomized TAB/CUTOUT with adjacency constraints
- Adjacent pieces: Complementary edges (TAB ↔ CUTOUT)

#### 1.2 Enhanced PuzzlePiece Model
```java
class PuzzlePiece {
    // Existing fields...
    private PieceShape shape;
    private EdgeCurve topEdge, rightEdge, bottomEdge, leftEdge;
    private BufferedImage shapedImage; // With alpha transparency
    private String svgPath; // For frontend rendering
}
```

### Phase 2: Shape Generation Algorithm

#### 2.1 Edge Pattern Generation
**Algorithm Steps:**
1. **Grid Analysis**: Identify border vs interior pieces
2. **Edge Assignment**: Assign FLAT to borders, generate TAB/CUTOUT for interior
3. **Adjacency Validation**: Ensure complementary edges between neighbors
4. **Curve Generation**: Create smooth Bezier curves for each non-flat edge

**Tab/Cutout Specifications:**
- **Tab Depth**: 25-35% of piece width/height
- **Knob Radius**: 40-60% of tab depth
- **Curve Smoothness**: 4-point Bezier curves
- **Randomization**: ±10% variation in size and position

#### 2.2 Shape Validation
- Ensure no isolated pieces (all pieces must connect)
- Validate edge compatibility matrix
- Check minimum piece area after shape cutting

### Phase 3: Image Processing Pipeline

#### 3.1 Shaped Image Creation
**Process:**
1. **Generate Piece Outline**: Create vector path from edge curves
2. **Create Alpha Mask**: Convert vector path to bitmap mask
3. **Apply Mask**: Extract shaped image with transparency
4. **Expand Canvas**: Add padding for tabs that extend beyond grid

**Technical Implementation:**
```java
// Pseudo-code for shaped image creation
BufferedImage createShapedPiece(BufferedImage original, PieceShape shape) {
    Graphics2D g2d = createGraphics();
    g2d.setClip(shape.getPath()); // Clip to jigsaw shape
    g2d.drawImage(original, 0, 0, null);
    return result;
}
```

#### 3.2 Canvas Expansion Strategy
- **Original Grid**: Base rectangular grid for reference
- **Expanded Bounds**: Add 40% padding on all sides for tabs
- **Image Sampling**: Sample from expanded area to fill tab regions

### Phase 4: Frontend Rendering Transformation

#### 4.1 SVG-Based Rendering
**Replace CSS backgrounds with SVG:**
```jsx
const PuzzlePiece = ({ piece }) => {
  return (
    <svg width={piece.bounds.width} height={piece.bounds.height}>
      <defs>
        <clipPath id={`piece-${piece.id}`}>
          <path d={piece.svgPath} />
        </clipPath>
      </defs>
      <image 
        href={piece.imageUrl}
        clipPath={`url(#piece-${piece.id})`}
        width="100%" height="100%"
      />
    </svg>
  );
};
```

#### 4.2 Collision Detection Update
- **Bounding Box**: Use expanded bounds for initial collision check
- **Precise Detection**: Use shape path for accurate collision detection
- **Edge Matching**: Implement tab-to-cutout fitting algorithm

### Phase 5: Connection and Snapping Logic

#### 5.1 Edge-Based Snapping
Replace grid-based snapping with edge-aware snapping:
- **Proximity Detection**: Find nearby pieces within connection threshold
- **Edge Compatibility**: Check if approaching edges are complementary
- **Alignment Calculation**: Calculate precise position for perfect fit
- **Snap Threshold**: 15-20px for edge-to-edge snapping

#### 5.2 Connected Piece Groups
- **Group Formation**: Track connected piece clusters
- **Group Movement**: Move entire connected groups together
- **Connection Validation**: Ensure connections remain valid during movement

### Phase 6: Backend API Enhancements

#### 6.1 New Endpoints
- `POST /api/puzzle/{sessionId}/generate-shapes`: Generate jigsaw shapes
- `GET /api/puzzle/{sessionId}/piece-shapes`: Retrieve piece shape definitions
- `POST /api/puzzle/{sessionId}/connect-pieces`: Handle piece connections

#### 6.2 WebSocket Message Types
- `PIECE_CONNECT`: Notify when pieces connect
- `PIECE_DISCONNECT`: Notify when pieces separate
- `GROUP_MOVE`: Synchronize connected group movement

### Phase 7: Storage and Caching

#### 7.1 Enhanced Redis Structure
```
puzzle:session:{sessionId}:shapes -> PieceShape definitions
puzzle:session:{sessionId}:connections -> Piece connection graph
puzzle:image:{pieceId}:shaped -> Shaped piece image with alpha
puzzle:image:{pieceId}:svg -> SVG path definition
```

#### 7.2 Caching Strategy
- **Shape Generation**: Cache generated shapes for reuse
- **Rendered Images**: Cache shaped piece images
- **SVG Paths**: Cache SVG path strings for frontend
